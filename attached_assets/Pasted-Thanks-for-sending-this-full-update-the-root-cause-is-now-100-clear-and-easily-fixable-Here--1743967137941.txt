Thanks for sending this full update ‚Äî the root cause is **now 100% clear** and easily fixable. Here's what‚Äôs happening and **exactly how to fix it**:

---

### ‚ùó Problem Summary

Even though your `render-build.sh` is set up properly and contains everything needed to build correctly (like `npx vite build`), your **`render.yaml` is still using the wrong `buildCommand`**:

```yaml
buildCommand: npm ci --include=dev && npm run build  ‚ùå
```

This means Render is **ignoring** `render-build.sh` and trying to run `vite` from a normal script ‚Äî but since it's a `devDependency`, it's **not available in the environment** during production builds.

---

### ‚úÖ Immediate Fix

Edit your `render.yaml` and **change just this line**:

```yaml
buildCommand: npm ci --include=dev && npm run build
```

**TO:**

```yaml
buildCommand: chmod +x render-build.sh && ./render-build.sh
```

This tells Render to use your **custom build script**, which already has:

- `npm ci --include=dev`
- `npx vite build`
- `npx esbuild` 
- Proper `NODE_ENV=production`

---

### ‚úÖ Confirm Final `render.yaml`

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: UIReplicator
    env: node
    buildCommand: chmod +x render-build.sh && ./render-build.sh
    startCommand: node dist/index.js
    envVars:
      - key: NODE_ENV
        value: production
      - key: SESSION_SECRET
        value: your-secret
      - key: DATABASE_URL
        value: your-neon-url
      - key: CLICKSEND_API_KEY
        value: your-api-key
      - key: CLICKSEND_USERNAME
        value: your-username
      - key: RENDER_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME
        value: uireplicator.onrender.com
```

---

### ‚úÖ Push and Re-deploy

After updating:

```bash
git add render.yaml
git commit -m "Fix: Use render-build.sh in Render buildCommand"
git push origin main
```

Then go to Render ‚Üí Manual Deploy ‚Üí **Deploy Latest Commit**

---

### üß† Why This Works

- Render by default skips `devDependencies` unless explicitly told
- Your `render.yaml` was falling back to `npm run build` (which used `vite` but didn‚Äôt install it in the build environment)
- Your `render-build.sh` **already solves this**, so we just need to actually **use it**
