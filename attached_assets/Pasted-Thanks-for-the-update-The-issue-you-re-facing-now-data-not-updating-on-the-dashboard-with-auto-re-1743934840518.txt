Thanks for the update. The issue you're facing now—**data not updating on the dashboard with auto-refresh not working**—can come from several possible causes. Based on your screenshot and everything done so far, here’s a step-by-step breakdown to pinpoint and resolve the issue:

---

### ✅ What’s working:
- **Your deployment is live** at `https://beyondgrooming.onrender.com/dashboard`
- The UI is rendering correctly
- The system says “Auto-refresh every 30s,” which means some kind of polling or WebSocket is intended

---

### ❌ What’s not working:
- Customers checking in (from your iPad or any device) **don’t appear** on the dashboard
- The dashboard data (Waiting / Almost Done) **stays at 0**
- **Auto-refresh doesn’t seem to be triggering** or pulling fresh data

---

### 🔍 Top Suspected Causes & How to Check Each

---

#### 1. **Auto-refresh Logic Not Triggering or Failing Silently**
✅ Check if the front-end dashboard has a `setInterval()` or WebSocket event calling the queue refresh endpoint (e.g. `/api/queue/stats` or `/api/queue`).

👉 **Debug Steps:**
- Open DevTools (`F12`) in your browser
- Go to the **Network tab**
- Wait ~30 seconds
- See if any calls are being made to an API (likely `/api/queue`, `/api/queue/stats`, etc.)
- If **nothing happens**, the timer may be broken.
- If there **is a call but the result is empty**, continue to step 2

---

#### 2. **API Returns Correct Data but Not Rendered**
✅ The client-side might be calling the backend, but it’s getting empty results because the database is empty (or wrong env).

👉 **Debug Steps:**
- Use browser DevTools Network → check the response from `/api/queue` or similar
- If it says `[]`, that means **nothing is being returned** by the backend
- Check if your Render app is **connected to the correct Neon DB** (via `DATABASE_URL`)
- You can log into Neon or use Postgres client to **inspect if any customers are present**

---

#### 3. **WebSocket Not Working on Render**
From earlier logs and screenshots, we know that:
- Replit was working ✅
- But Render logs were showing **WebSocket disconnects or 401 Unauthorized**

👉 This suggests your **live updating** may **depend on WebSockets**, and they’re **failing on Render**.

📌 Since the dashboard says **"Auto-refresh every 30s"**, your app might be falling back to polling — but if polling isn't implemented correctly, it won’t update.

---

#### 4. **The Backend is Not Returning Real-Time Data**
Your backend may be filtering data based on:
- `shopId`
- `isServed`
- `status` or `paymentVerified`

👉 **Check if the query logic is like:**
```ts
SELECT * FROM queue WHERE isServed = false
```
If no customers are added to the queue in this database, **it will return empty results**.

---

### ✅ Quick Fix Checklist

| Step | What to check | Action |
|------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | DevTools > Network > Look for fetch call | Is it hitting the API every 30s? |
| 2 | DevTools > Console | Any JS errors? CORS errors? |
| 3 | Database content | Log into Neon and check if any rows exist |
| 4 | WebSocket vs Polling | If WebSocket fails, does polling fallback work properly? |
| 5 | Render logs | Any errors in `/api/queue` or `/api/auth/session` |

---

### ✅ Temporary Debug Solution
If WebSockets are not reliable on Render, switch to polling:

```ts
// in dashboard page (example only)
setInterval(async () => {
  const res = await fetch('/api/queue/stats');
  const data = await res.json();
  updateDashboard(data);
}, 30000); // every 30s
```

You can also **temporarily add a debug log** to confirm it's hitting:
```ts
console.log("Polling queue stats");
```

---

Would you like to:
1. **Check the Network tab together**?
2. **Log a debug statement in the code** to confirm polling/WebSocket is firing?
3. **Inspect the Neon DB directly** to confirm customers exist?
