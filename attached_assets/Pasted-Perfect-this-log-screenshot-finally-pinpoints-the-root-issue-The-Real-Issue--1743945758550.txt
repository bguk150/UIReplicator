## 🚨 The Real Issue: **401 Unauthorized on `/api/queue` and `/api/queue/stats`**

You're seeing repeated errors like:
```
GET /api/queue 401 in 1ms :: {"message":"Unauthorized"}
```

### 💡 This means:
- The dashboard is polling `GET /api/queue` and/or `/api/queue/stats` ✅
- BUT... the request is **unauthorized**, so the backend returns an empty result or error ❌
- That’s why no customers appear on the dashboard — your server **refuses to send data** to unauthenticated users

---

## 🔍 Why it worked on Replit but fails on Render:
Replit was likely preserving the login session (`connect.sid` cookie) properly.

On **Render**, one of the following might be happening:
- Cookies are not being sent properly from the frontend to the backend
- You switched to HTTPS → SameSite/secure cookies misconfigured
- The API expects an auth session but your deployed version **forgets** to include it

---

## ✅ Confirm It’s a Cookie/Auth Issue:
In Chrome DevTools:
1. Go to the **Application tab** > Cookies > `beyondgrooming.onrender.com`
2. Look for the `connect.sid` cookie
3. Is it there? Is `Secure` and `SameSite` set to strict?
4. Open **Network tab** → see if `/api/queue` request **sends cookies** under `Request Headers`

---

## ✅ Recommended Fix

### Option 1: **Expose `/api/queue` & `/api/queue/stats` Without Auth**
If you’re not dealing with sensitive data:
```ts
// In your Express backend:
app.get('/api/queue', (req, res) => {
  // remove or bypass `if (!req.session.user)` auth guard here
  res.json(queue);
});
```

Only do this **if the dashboard is public** or you're okay with unauthenticated visibility.

---

### Option 2: **Ensure Cookies Are Sent + Server Reads Them**
If you want secure sessions:

#### 1. Add this to your server:
```ts
import cors from 'cors';

app.use(cors({
  origin: 'https://beyondgrooming.onrender.com',
  credentials: true, // 👈 Important
}));
```

#### 2. And on the frontend fetch call:
```ts
await fetch('/api/queue/stats', {
  credentials: 'include', // 👈 sends cookies
});
```

#### 3. Ensure your session middleware supports this:
```ts
app.use(session({
  secret: 'yourSecret',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  cookie: {
    secure: true, // Required for HTTPS
    sameSite: 'none', // Allow cross-origin
  },
}));
```

---

## ✅ Quick Temporary Fix (to test visibility)

Just to confirm it works:
- Temporarily remove `if (!req.session.user)` checks from `/api/queue`
- Re-deploy to Render
- See if customers show up in dashboard (this confirms it's **100% auth/session issue**)

---

Let me know if you'd prefer:
1. A full walkthrough to **fix sessions properly**
2. A quick bypass to **test if the dashboard works when public**
