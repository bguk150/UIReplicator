Here's a detailed prompt based on the simplified and clear breakdown:

**Prompt: Build the Beyond Grooming Queue Management App**

**Objective:**  
We need a web app to manage the queue and customer details for the Beyond Grooming barbershop. The app should have a Customer Check-In Page and a Barber Dashboard, integrated with ClickSend SMS for sending notifications to customers. The app should be built using Supabase for real-time data storage and management, with a modern and clean dark theme for the UI.

---

### 1. **Customer Check-In Page (Public Page)**
   - **Fields:** 
     - **Name** (Text Input)
     - **Phone Number** (Text Input, UK format)
     - **Service Type** (Dropdown with options like Haircut, Beard Trim, etc.)
     - **Payment Method** (Dropdown: Cash or Card)
   - **On Form Submission:**
     - The backend will auto-fill the following fields in the Supabase table `queue`:
       - `check_in_time` (timestamp)
       - `status` (default "Waiting")
       - `payment_verified` (default "No")
       - `sms_sent` (default "No")

---

### 2. **Barber Dashboard (Private Page)**
   - **Login Page**:
     - Use the credentials: `beyondgroominguk@gmail.com` / `bg_uk123` to log in.
   - **Dashboard Functionality:**
     - View a list of customers in the queue with details such as:
       - **Name**
       - **Service Type**
       - **Phone Number**
       - **Check-in Time** (displayed in HH:MM:SS format)
     - **Actions per Customer**:
       - **Verify Cash Payment** (only visible when the payment method is "Cash" and `payment_verified` is "No")
         - When clicked: Set `payment_verified = "Yes"`
       - **Almost Done** (updates customer status to "Almost Done")
         - When clicked: Set `status = "Almost Done"`, `sms_sent = "Yes"`, and trigger an SMS to the customer using the ClickSend API.
       - **Mark as Served** (removes customer from the queue once they’ve been served)
         - When clicked: Set `status = "Served"` and remove the customer from the dashboard.

---

### 3. **SMS Integration (ClickSend API)**
   - **Trigger SMS via ClickSend** when the **"Almost Done"** button is clicked:
     - **Message Content:**
       - "Hi {name}, you're next in line at Beyond Grooming! Please come in now and secure your spot in the chair."
     - Use the **ClickSend API** to send the SMS to the customer’s phone number.
     - Credentials: Use the **Base64-encoded API credentials** below in the `supabase.ts` file:
       - `NkUxQUJFRDEtRTZCRi1GMUJGLUI0RUMtODYzN0YxNzJGMkNE`

---

### 4. **UI Design and Customization**
   - **Overall Theme**: Modern, clean dark theme with a slight gradient.
   - **Colors:**
     - **Background**: Dark charcoal (`#1A1F2C`)
     - **Accent Colors**: Blue-ish tones like (`#4C6D7C`)
     - **Button Colors:**
       - **Almost Done**: Mango yellow (`#FEC6A1`)
       - **Mark as Served**: Green (`#C2F2C3`)
       - **Verify Cash**: Light blue (`#D3E4FD`)
     - **Text**: White (`#FFFFFF`) and light grey (`#D3D3D3`)
   - **Typography & UI:**
     - **Large bold headings** for easy visibility
     - **Clean card design** with subtle shadows
     - **Touch-friendly buttons** with icons: clock for time, checkmark for served, cash symbol for cash payments

---

### 5. **Barber Dashboard – Logout & Authentication**
   - **Logout Behavior**:
     - Ensure that the Barber Dashboard is protected and requires authentication. When logging out or navigating back to the Check-In Page, users should be logged out automatically.
   - **UI Clean-up**:
     - Remove unnecessary UI text like "Queue Management" and "Managing customer queue efficiently". The UI should be clean and focused on the queue details and customer actions.

---

### 6. **Final Testing & Refinements**
   - **Testing Steps**:
     1. Test **Customer Check-In** form to ensure data is added to the Supabase `queue` table correctly.
     2. Test **Login and Logout** functionality for the Barber Dashboard.
     3. Verify that the **"Almost Done"** button triggers the SMS to the customer’s phone number correctly.
     4. Verify that **Mark as Served** removes the customer from the queue.
   - **Refinement**: Make any necessary adjustments to ensure smooth flow and functionality.

---

### 7. **Additional Notes**:
   - **Public Access**: The Check-In page should be accessible publicly, while the Barber Dashboard should only be accessible after logging in.
   - **Security Considerations**: Ensure that the credentials for ClickSend API are correctly integrated and stored securely.

Once the application is complete, it should be fully functional with all requested features, ready for use in the barbershop.
