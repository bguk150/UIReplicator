The SMS functionality works as follows:

1. **Trigger Event: "Almost Done" Button Click**
   - The process begins when the barber clicks the **"Almost Done"** button on the Barber Dashboard.
   - This button is visible when a customer is checked in and is next in line but hasn’t been marked as "Served."

2. **Update Customer's Status**
   - When the **"Almost Done"** button is clicked, two things happen:
     - The **status** of the customer is updated to **"Almost Done"**.
     - The **sms_sent** flag for that customer is set to **"Yes"**, indicating that the SMS has been triggered.

3. **Prepare the Message**
   - A message is crafted to notify the customer that they are next in line. The message includes:
     - The customer's name
     - Information about the queue status and the time they need to arrive.

   The message content is:
   ```
   Hi, it’s Beyond Grooming✂️💈

   Just a heads-up – there’s 1 person ahead of you in the queue! You’ve got 15 minutes to arrive and secure your spot in the chair.

   Don’t lose your deposit – make it on time!

   See you soon!
   ```

4. **Send the SMS**
   - The system then uses an SMS service (like ClickSend) to send the prepared message to the customer's phone number.
   - The message is sent via an API request, using the customer's phone number and the message text.

5. **Confirm SMS Delivery**
   - After the message is sent, the system confirms that the SMS has been successfully sent. If the SMS is sent successfully, the **sms_sent** field in the database is updated to **"Yes"**.
   
6. **User Experience**
   - The customer receives the SMS on their phone, informing them of their position in the queue and the time they have to arrive.
   - This reduces the need for barbers to manually notify customers and helps streamline the queue process.
